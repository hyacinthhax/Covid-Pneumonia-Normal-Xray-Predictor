# Covid-Pneumonia-Normal-Xray-Predictor
This is a python deep learning project I made; It trains on a large dataset and outputs a predictionof Pneumonia, Normal, or Covid19. The model is trained on 256X256 PNG Images dataset from Sachin Kumar. Kumar, Sachin (2022), “Covid19-Pneumonia-Normal Chest X-Ray Images”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/dvntn9yhd2.1

Here's the website I got the dataset from: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/dvntn9yhd2/1
